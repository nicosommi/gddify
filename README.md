It makes it easy to work with the GDD approach.
Compose software components by putting blocks togheter and updating them whenever you want.
Ah yeah, and with no development effort for generators and template creation.
Thinked with the SRP in mind, this is ideal for microservices.
It let's you minimize the maintenance effort at almost no additional cost.
It's also useful for scaffolding and quality assurance across your company, among other things.

## Usage examples
### Prerequisites
```shell
npm init
npm i gdd --save-dev
```
After that, add this line in your scripts section of your package.json:
```javascript
"scripts": {
	"gddify": "gddify"
}
```
And you're ready to proceed with the first generation.

### Generation / Creation / Source addition
#### From the registered public sw component ng (node, angular, es6, browserify, express, bootstrap, jquery, etc.):
```shell
npm run gddify generate -- --from ng
```
And there you are, you have a fully functional webapp.

#### From your git repository:
```shell
npm run gddify generate -- --from gitrepository:https://github.com/me/myotherproject
```
#### From your local path:
```shell
npm run gddify generate -- --from localpath:../myotherproject
```

### Update
```shell
npm run gddify update
```
With this you will pull all of your block to the latest version according to the sources that they have configured.
Gdd compares using the semver package.

### Refresh
```shell
npm run gddify refresh
```
This is just an update from the local project.

### Compile
```shell
npm run gddify compile
```
This will clean up your component to the configured folder.

### Add
```shell
npm run gddify add -- --name mycomponent --type tasks --glob "./tasks/**/*"
```
This adds all files that matches the glob into a component name mycomponent of type tasks (create or append).

## How it works
Basically, it creates and maintains a swComponent.json on the project roots with the information related to your project and their sources.
Using that, it implements the [GDD approach](http://nicosommi.com), based on gene, block and component information provided by other GDD projects out there.

With gdd you will be able to create and compose projects from your other projects or from projects on the repo.

*Use cases? A lot.*
Microservices, project bootstrapping, scaffolding, among others.

*Is this different than yeoman? Absolutely.*
Gddify is a development process aspect/practice that you can attach to your development process, more like TDD/BDD. It's true that you may accomplish with gdd the same stuff that you previously did with yeoman, and it does not require ANY effort on building up a generator, it uses meta information provided by the source code files by following the development process aspect.

*Does gdd use any template language to build concrete files? No.*
Read more why [here](http://nicosommi.com).

*There is any advatange by using this approach? A lot.*
For example, you can test everything you do with no rare/template code, just regular development in your well known main source code language.
No more question/wizard development.
The impact for technology decisions and package-lock is now minimized.
There are more advatanges, keep reading [here](http://nicosommi.com).

*Can I use gdd on other languages different than javascript? Yes.*
It's language agnostic. You will need node.js installed in order to run it, but it can contain any kind of components. Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, etc.

*There is a repo with known packages? Yes.*
Currently it's built-in inside this package. As the community grows and contributes there will be an official repo. If you want to submit your project to be in the repo, feel free to open a new issue or create a new PR.

*Can I install gdd globally? Yes.*
But, please, don't. Read why [here](http://nicosommi.com/?p=518).

# Installation

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal to install Gddify:

```
npm install gdd --save-dev
```

# How to Contribute

You can submit your ideas through our [issues system](https://github.com/nicosommi/gdd/issues), or make the modifications yourself and submit them to us in the form of a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Also I accept [donations](http://nicosommi.com). Since this was done by me for free, and I REALLY need donations.

## Running Tests

It's easy to run the test suite locally, and *highly recommended* if you're using Gddify.js on a platform we aren't automatically testing for.

```
npm test
```
