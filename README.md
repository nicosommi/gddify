<!-- ph description -->
It makes it easy to work with the GDD approach... which is still in development.

The idea is to create self describing software components that hold software blocks that are similar patterns among files.

With that self describing meta data in place on the source code you get code generation and synchronization for free. No more generator development.

<!-- ph usagesAndExamples -->
## Quickstart / Cookbook for a node.js library
```shell
npm i -g gddify

mkdir myproject
cd myproject
npm init

npm i git://github.com/nicosommi/gene-js.git

gddify generate --from ./node_modules/gene-js

npm i
```
Then, customize the files at your own taste (replacements, place holders and stamps).

Then, run
```shell
gddify refresh

npm test
```

And there you go, a node.js library with es6, test, watch, a LICENSE, a README.md, a .gitignore, and more things to come soon.

## Usage & examples
### Prerequisites per project
```shell
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
npm init
npm i gddify --save-dev
```
After that, add this line in your scripts section of your package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
	"gddify": "gddify"
}
```
And you're ready to proceed with your first generation.

Oh yeah you can also use it globally, it's easier, but [I don't like it](http://nicosommi.com/?p=518) for most cases. Just like this:
```shell
npm i -g gddify
```

### Generation / Creation / Source addition
#### Create
```shell
npm install git://github.com/nicosommi/gddify.git
gddify generate --from ./node_modules/gddify
```
That's almost it, you have a clone from gddify. Now you need to edit the meta data and refresh. But hey, don't get me wrong. Is just a GDD developed library. It can be anything from any repo that was created following GDD.

Also, you can generate just some blocks with type filtering (or name filtering):
```shell
gddify generate --from ./.sources/gddify --type runtime
```

The project-local option (and all will be with this format):
```shell
npm run gddify generate -- --from node_modules/webapp
```

### Update
```shell
gddify update
```
With this you will pull all of your block to the latest version according to the sources that they have configured.
Gdd compares using the semver package.

Update also supports type and name filtering.

Update will not generate new blocks from sources.

### Refresh
```shell
gddify refresh
```
This is just an update from the local project. Also supports filtering.

### Compile
```shell
gddify compile
```
This will clean up your component's meta data and it will throw the files into the configured folder.

### Add
```shell
gddify add --name mycomponent --type tasks --glob "./tasks/**/*"
```
This adds all files that matches the glob into a component named mycomponent of type tasks (create or append).

### Add file
```shell
gddify addfile --name mycomponent --type tasks --path "./tasks/build.js"
```
This adds that file into a component named mycomponent of type tasks (create or append).

### Increment
```shell
gddify increment --name mycomponent --type tasks --release "patch"
gddify increment --name mycomponent --type tasks --release "minor"
gddify increment --name mycomponent --type tasks --release "major"
```
This increments the version component named mycomponent of type tasks using the release type (according to [semver](http://semver.npmjs.com/)).
It's particularly useful when you want to allow other blocks to be refreshed/updated.

<!-- ph howItWorks -->
## How it works
Basically, it creates and maintains a swComponent.json on the project roots with the information related to your project and their sources.  

Using that, it implements the [GDD approach](http://nicosommi.com), based on gene, block and component information provided by other GDD projects out there.

With gdd you will be able to create and compose projects from your other projects or from projects on the repo.

## F.A.Q.
*Use cases? A lot.*  
Microservices, project bootstrapping, scaffolding (and with updates), among others.

*Is it hard to learn? No.*  
It aims to be intuitive. It will require a mindset change and some time thinking about how are you going to build your components and blocks. But once that's done is common sense.  
It will take some time to understand the commands here and the GDD approach.  
As this is a change in your current workflow it may be uncomfortable at the beginning, but you get used to it.
Technically speaking, the most advanced task you will need to do is to create a regular expressions for string replacement.  
If you don't know what that is go [here](http://nicosommi.com).

*Is this different than yeoman? Absolutely.*  
Gddify is a tool for applying a development process aspect/practice that you can attach to your development process, like TDD/BDD (but with a different purpose).
You can just have code generation and refresh for free.

*Does gdd use any template language to build concrete files? No.*  
You don't have to *learn* anything special. Read more why [here](http://nicosommi.com).

*There is any advatange by using this approach? A lot.*  
For example, you can test everything you do with no rare/template code, just regular development in your well known main source code language.
No more reinventing the wheel everytime.
No more question/wizard/generator development.
No vendor-lock learning curve.
There are more advatanges, keep reading [here](http://nicosommi.com).

*Can I use gdd on other languages different than javascript? Yes.*  
It's language agnostic. You will need node.js installed in order to run it, but it can contain any kind of components. Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, etc.

*There is a repo with known packages? No.*
You can just use any repo or even folder that contains a valid swComponent.json file!

*Can I install gdd globally? Yes.*  

*Can I use it already? Yes.*  
But as it's still on a early-early-early version, so you should use it carefully, taking care of committing all your changes before running gddify, so you can always stash them after that. It's not rock solid yet but it has a high test coverage and it follow good practices for the source code (js standard). Also, on complex cases you will need to do some stuff manually yet.

*There are requirements to use gddify? Yes.*  
Gddify requires node.js and your commitment to the GDD approach to be really useful.

*What happens with files with no comment support? We use a intermmediate file.*  
For example, for package.json, you can maintain a package.js that, using the provided jsonification command, compiles that js to package.json automatically. You can see how it's done by looking the swComponent.json for this repo.  
You can configure blocks to jsonificate, copy or move their files after the synchronization occurs.

# How to Contribute

You can submit your ideas through our [issues system](https://github.com/nicosommi/gddify/issues), or make the modifications yourself and submit them to us in the form of a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Test coverage and js standard is a must for this project.

## Running Tests

It's easy to run the test suite locally, and *highly recommended* if you're using gddify on a platform we aren't automatically testing for.

```
npm test
